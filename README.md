# Madhav-E-commerce-Sales-Analysis


This project analyzes retail order data from Madhav E-Commerce for 2022 and 2023, covering over 10,000 transactions from cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Surat, Mathura, Indore, and Prayagraj. The dataset comprises order details, transaction amounts, profits, quantities, categories, and payment modes. Data processing involved importing CSV files, cleaning, and standardizing the datasets. Using Power Query, the data was transformed, changing data types and creating custom columns. Group By operations were performed to summarize data based on categories and subcategories.

The analysis focused on identifying monthly sales trends, peak sales periods, and regional performance variations. Profit analysis highlighted total profit per order and identified losses, with visualizations showcasing profit trends over time and by category. Quantity analysis evaluated order quantities, revealing popular products and high-demand periods. Customer insights were derived by categorizing age groups and payment modes, analyzing purchasing patterns, and assessing the impact of different payment methods on sales and profitability.

Interactive dashboards were developed in Power BI, enabling stakeholders to engage with data and gain actionable insights efficiently.
